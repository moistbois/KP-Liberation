# Talvivaara 1939 Winter War

## Cool stuff
1. Battlegroups spawn and work pretty well
2. Arsenal configured to contain Finnish gear available in 1939
3. None of the player slots spawn in OOB hell anymore :)
4. Bunch of realism improving tweaks
5. TRENCHSCOPE (wooden) 

## Broken stuff
1. AI artillery callins don't work at all
2. Civilian reputation penalty on destroying buildings currently turned off
3. Some small issues/inconsistencies from NF mod:
   1. Mortar sights
   2. No tracers for deployable Maxim
4. Retarded civilians
